# Armstrong Number

C++ program to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. Explanation of Armstrong numbers and examples.

## What is an Armstrong Number?

An **Armstrong number** (also known as a **narcissistic number**) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits. For example:

- \(153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\)
- \(9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4\)

### Formula
For an n-digit number, the formula is:

\[
\text{Armstrong Number} = d_1^n + d_2^n + \dots + d_k^n
\]

Where:
- \(d_1, d_2, \dots, d_k\) are the digits of the number
- \(n\) is the total number of digits


## Sample Output

### Example 1:
Input:
```
153
```
Output:
```
153 is an Armstrong number.
```

### Example 2:
Input:
```
123
```
Output:
```
123 is not an Armstrong number.
```
